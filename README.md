1st : Stairs.py => It consists to input a integer number and then a stairs appairs like this : ( with the number 4)
   #
  ##
 ###
####

2nd : Uppercase.py => It consists of transforming a string that we put as input into one capital letter out of two :
for example with the string "Hello World" : 
>>> HeLlO wOrLd 

3rd : Factorial.py => Typical factorial function ( factorial of 4 is 24 )

4th : Sort.py => You put a series of numbers and they are then sorted in descending order ( for example : 5,8,19,4,53 )
>>> [53, 19, 8, 5, 4]

5th : Rectangle.py => It consists in finding the position of an element in another if there is one and then give the position
of the first element in the another one.

6th : Anagram.py => Is to enter two separate words and see if they are anagrams or not (e.g : "Listen" and "Silent" are anagrams)

7th : Sudoku.py => Replace all "0" occurences by numbers (1 to 9) who aren't already in the square, or in the row, or in the column
